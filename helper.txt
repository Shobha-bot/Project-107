 Now start coding in the main.js file:

Define the startClassification() function which will be called on the onclick event of the START button.  Done

 Write the following code inside this function:

Write code to access the microphone of your system. Done

Then, use ml5.soundClassifier() and store the trained teachable machine model in the classifier variable. Done

 This function takes 2 parameters:

Put the Teachable machine model link which you created in the previous project. Done

 - Note: Concatenate the model links string with the ‘model.json’ string. Done

Function which will be called once the model is loaded - modelReady. Done

Then, define the modelReady() function. Done

Write code to compare the trained model with the audio captured from the microphone. Done

Use classifier.classify() which will compare the audio captured with the trained model and give a result. Done

 This function takes a parameter:

Function name - which will contain the result of this comparison - gotResults() Done

Define gotResults() function. Done

This function takes 2 parameters - error and results- Done:

Inside this function, we will write code to print the ‘got result’ string on the console. Done

 We will be writing the main code inside this function in the next project. Done
